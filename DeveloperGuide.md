# Introduction #

Quick start guide for developers interested in working on Denumerous

# Details #

Stuff You'll Need
  * [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)  (if you've not used Maven before, check out the [Maven Users Centre](http://maven.apache.org/users/index.html) for instructions and examples)
  * A Subversion client (we recommend [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/))
  * Your favorite IDE

Steps to join the project
  * Use your Subversion client to check out the latest source: http://denumerous.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  * Use Maven to build and run tests (e.g. "mvn install" from the root denumerous folder)
  * You can also use Maven to generate projects for many popular IDEs (e.g. running "mvn eclipse:eclipse" from the root denumerous folder will generate Eclipse projects for Denumerous)

Maven makes things pretty painless once you get used to how it works.
