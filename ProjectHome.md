The goal of this project will be to create an open-source library with implementations for a variety of test combination generation algorithms.  Combinatorial testing provides testers with a technique for reducing test cases to a manageable number while insuring that all n-way interactions of selected variables are exercised.  Currently, Denumerous only supports "pairwise" or 2-way test case generation.

Although there are a significant number of tools available with this functionality, there is not a good open-source alternative with these characteristics:

  * implemented in Java
  * command-line and web interfaces
  * core library that can be used in other tools such as test harnesses and test management tools
  * framework for easily adding new generation techniques.

As Denumerous matures, we hope it can fill this gap, providing functionality and an opportunity to learn about techniques for combinatorial test generation.

If you want to see the how the application looks right now, it is running on Google's App Engine.  See the first external link.
